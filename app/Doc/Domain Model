Classes:

Monsters witb coordinates are monsters. The former is thus a subclass.

The concrete observers are DefaultOnTouchListener, GameDurationObserver, MonsterView,
and UpdateMonstersListener. (The MonsterView's update method is to invalidate the view.)

Instances:

The controller (specifically in the class Board_Calculations) is composed of a model and a view.
It serves as an "interface" between the two components, updating each part and calling appropriate
methods. This is consistent with MVC.

The model has monsters with coordinates (and methods to update their positions).
The view has a canvas to display to the user.
